The folders here contain 3d models of any ‘non-standard’ part, meaning the kicad libraries don’t contain them. Folders are named to match kicad’s naming convention so you can merge them with the global folders if you’d like (/Library/Application Support/kicad/modules/packages3d). This will allow you to use the same models between projects without having to change file paths. 

If you need/want any other 3d models for the project, please let me know and I’ll get them to you.
